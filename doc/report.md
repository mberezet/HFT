##1 Abstract
Our project goal is to create a High Frequency Trading (HFT) platform on an Altera Cyclone V SoCKit board that can detect arbitrage opportunities in the Foreign Exchange (FOREX) Market.  Simulated data is streamed to the FPGA and stored in on-chip memory.  The FPGA runs the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the data and checks for negative weight cycles.

##2 Introduction
High frequency trading is a trading platform that uses computer algorithms and powerful technology tools to perform a large number of trades at very high speeds. Initially, HFT firms operated on a time scale of seconds, but as technology has improved, so has the time required to execute a trade. Firms now compete at the milli- or even microsecond level. This has led to many firms turning to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to achieve greater performance.

Our project focuses on triangular arbitrage opportunities on the foreign exchange market (Forex). The Forex market is a decentralized marketplace for trading currency. All trading is conducted over the counter via computer networks between traders around the world. Unlike the stock market, the Forex market is open 24 hours for most of the week.

Currencies are priced in relation to each other and quoted in pairs that look like this: `EUR/USD 1.1837`. The currency on the left is the base currency and the one on the right is called the cross currency or quote. The base currency is always assumed to be one unit, and the quoted price is what the base currency is equal to in the other currency. In this example, `1 Euro = 1.1837 USD.`

Triangular arbitrage takes advantage of pricing inequalities across three or more different currencies to make a profit. In a three currency situation, one currency is exchanged for a second, the second for a third currency, and finally the third back to the original currency. For example, if the exchange rates for the following currency pairs were `EUR/USD 1.1837`, `EUR/GBP 0.7231`, and `GBP/USD 1.6388` a  trader could use 11,847 USD to buy 10,000 Euros.  Those Euros could be sold for 7231 British Pounds, which could then be sold for 11,850 USD, netting a profit of 13 USD. Unfortunately, acting on these price inefficiencies quickly corrects them, meaning traders must be ready to act immediately when an arbitrage opportunity occurs.

Our group hopes to implement a Forex arbitrage calculator on an FPGA using a parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm. We believe this will be fast enough to detect and act on arbitrage opportunities in near real time.

####3.3.3 VGA
To show the negative cycles (paths for exchanging currencies to make profits) clearly, we used the VGA module to generate numbers, indicating each currency within the cycle, in series on the screen. As shown in ****Fig. 1000**, when we press “enter” on the cycle we are choosing, each number will be translated into abbreviated characters to show the chain in a more readable way. Since we are calculating the currencies represented by indices in the Bellman Ford and Cycle detect calculation module, the results are those indices. It is easier for us to show those indices first on the screen and then convert into characters. For each index we have, we need to read it from the memory and translated into 2-digits number to show. Between each of these currencies, we also need an arrow to tell us the direction of the negative cycle, in other words, the way of exchanging currencies.
These numbers and characters are shown by 16x16 pixels on the screen and stored in one big Rom memory. Thus, we need 256 bits to store each of them with their own addresses in the memory and read them according to the numbers and characters needed to show on the screen. All of these numbers and characters are sprites, and we have total 38 sprites including: 26 capital characters, 10 digit numbers, 1 arrow and 1 totally black. Each sprite is first generated by mif file manually and then join them together into a big mif file. After the big mif file is generated, it can be used to create the memory we need via MegaWizard Plug-in Manager in Quartus II. The relevant code of reading memory is shown **as following*****:

####3.3.3.2 Keyboard

As mentioned before, when we press “enter” on the keyboard connected to the FPGA as peripheral, the cycle can be shown in a more readable way. This is supported by Usblib module, making communication between the peripheral (keyboard) and the FPGA. Four keys are defined “esc”, “enter”, “upshift” and “downshift”. When the software built in the arm processor receives those four keys, it will transmit corresponding data to the FPGA via Avalon Bus as what we did in lab3 and to indicate the operation shown on the screen. When in the cycle we find out, “enter” gives us the name of each currencies and shown in the middle of the screen. When we are in the “enter” state, only “esc” can be responded and exit to the state before the “enter” state, and we can choose the cycle via pressing “upshift” and “downshift” keys.
